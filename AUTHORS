Shachar Raindel - a patch to bring the "get linux to emit ENOBUFS"
functionality from classic netperf tests to the omni tests.

once by obtaining the 16 bytes of randomness for the UUID via slightly
different means.  Dump TCP_INFO results to stderr when either debug >
1 or DUMP_TCP_INFO envvar is set.  Bump the listen backlog for the
control endpoint to 1024.   Also, tweak to set the SO_MAX_PACING_RATE.

Brian Ginsbach - pointing-out that relying on being able to do a
                 protocol lookup on "ip" isn't going to work with all
                 Distros.

John Baldwin - Support for POSIX AIO
