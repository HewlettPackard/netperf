It has been reported that versions of netperf have configured and
compiled under Cygwin.  

It is also known that netperf has compiled using the Windows DDK.
Here is a skeleton of the instructions to do so:

Steps are:

A) Install the Windows driver developer kit (if not already done).

B) open a Cmd windows (i.e., a DOS box) for the target environment
   (target OS version; free vs checked build; x86, AMD64, or IA64).
   This is picked from the "Start\Developer Kits" path.

C) go to the netperf\src directory and type "build /cD".

D) the target files will be in a directory like:
   NetPerf\objchk_wnet_IA64\IA64, NetServer\objchk_wnet_IA64\IA64
   NetPerf\objfre_wnet_x86\i386, or NetPerf\objfre_wnet_AMD64\amd64
