dnl Check for socklen_t: historically on BSD it is an int, and in
dnl POSIX 1g it is a type of its own, but some platforms use different
dnl types for the argument to getsockopt, getpeername, etc.  So we
dnl have to test to find something that will work.

dnl Remove the AC_CHECK_TYPE - on HP-UX it would find a socklen_t, but the 
dnl function prototypes for getsockopt et al will not actually use 
dnl socklen_t args unless _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED is defined. so, the
dnl AC_CHECK_TYPE will find a socklen_t and think all is happiness and
dnl joy when you will really get warnings about mismatch types - type
dnl mismatches that would be possibly Bad (tm) in a 64-bit compile.
