Pseudo-random things about netperf on AIX:

While it _should_ not be necessary in the release bits, the rc bits
for netperf 2.4.0 required:

    configure _may_ need:

    CFLAGS="-qcpluscmt -lperfstat"

    until such time as Rick Jones can figure-out or be told how to
    automagically add those using the configure script (hint hint :)

The release bits should be OK without the above.  Depending on the
name used to invoke the compiler, the -qmumble option may be implicit.

AIX include files have a VERY unfortuneate set of #define's in them
for phrases network oriented programs are QUITE likely to have in
their source - "rem_addr" and "rem_size" A "cousin" of the Netperf
Contributing Editor reports this interferes with --enable-dlpi
compilation and that it was also a problem for MySQL compiltion.
While we await IBM's APAR with bated breath, netperf has been kludged
to workaround this bug in IBM's include files.
