Until the release bits the following was true:

    Until such time as Rick Jones can figure-out or be told how to make it
    automagic in the configure script, prior to configure on solaris, you
    may need:

    CFLAGS="-lsocket -lnsl -lkstat"

    and if you are trying to compile the SCTP tests:

    CFLAGS="-lxnet -lsocket -lnsl -lkstat -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500 -D__EXTENSIONS__"

as the release bits have a "smarter" configure script, and the SCTP
tests use libsctp, the above no longer applies.  It should all just be
automagic (although for SCTP you still must --enable-sctp at configure
time)

beware CPU util figures on anything before Solaris 10 that does not
say 100%, and still be a triffle cautious with Solaris 10 CPU util
reports.
