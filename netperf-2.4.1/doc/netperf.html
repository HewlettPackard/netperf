<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p><a name="index-chapter_002c-Introduction-1"></a>
Netperf is a benchmark that can be use to measure various aspect of
networking performance.  The primary foci are bulk (aka
unidirectional) data transfer and request/response performance using
either TCP or UDP and the Berkeley Sockets interface.  As of this
writing, the tests available either unconditionally or conditionally
include:

     <ul>
<li>TCP and UDP unidirectional transfer and request/response over IPv4 and
IPv6 using the Sockets interface. 
<li>TCP and UDP unidirectional transfer and request/response over IPv4
using the XTI interface. 
<li>Link-level unidirectional transfer and request/response using the DLPI
interface. 
<li>Unix domain sockets
<li>SCTP unidirectional transfer and request/response over IPv4 and IPv6
using the sockets interface. 
</ul>

   <p>While not every revision of netperf will work on every platform
listed, the intention is that at least some version of netperf will
work on the following platforms:

     <ul>
<li>Unix - at least all the major variants. 
<li>Linux
<li>Windows
<li>OpenVMS
<li>Others
</ul>

   <p>Netperf is maintained and informally supported primarily by Rick
Jones, who can perhaps be best described as Netperf Contributing
Editor.  Non-trivial and very appreciated assistance comes from others
in the network performance community, who are too numerous to mention
here. Netperf is NOT supported via any of the formal Hewlett-Packard
support channels.  You should feel free to make enhancements and
modifications to netperf to suit your nefarious porpoises, so long as
you stay within the guidelines of the netperf copyright.  If you feel
so inclined, you can send your changes to
<a href="mailto:netperf-feedback@netperf.org">netperf-feedback</a> for possible
inclusion into subsequent versions of netperf.

   <p>The <a href="mailto:netperf-talk@netperf.org">netperf-talk</a> mailing list is available to discuss the
care and feeding of netperf with others who share your interest in
network performance benchmarking. The netperf-talk mailing list is a
closed list and you must first subscribe by sending email to <a href="mailto:netperf-talk-request@netperf.org">netperf-talk-request</a>.

<h3 class="section">1.1 Conventions</h3>

<p>A <dfn>sizespec</dfn> is a one or two item, comma-separated list used as an
argument to a command-line option that can set one or two, related
netperf parameters.  If you wish to set both parameters to separate
values, items should be separated by a comma:

<pre class="example">     parameter1,parameter2
</pre>
   <p>If you wish to set the first parameter without altering the value of
the second from its default, you should follow the first item with a
comma:

<pre class="example">     parameter1,
</pre>
   <p>Likewise, precede the item with a comma if you wish to set only the
second parameter:

<pre class="example">     ,parameter2
</pre>
   <p>An item with no commas:

<pre class="example">     parameter1and2
</pre>
   <p>will set both parameters to the same value.  This last mode is one of
the most frequently used.

   <p>There is another variant of the comma-separated, two-item list called
a <dfn>optionspec</dfn> which is like a sizespec with the exception that a
single item with no comma:

<pre class="example">     parameter1
</pre>
   <p>will only set the value of the first parameter and will leave the
second parameter at its default value.

   <p>Netperf has two types of command-line options.  The first are global
command line options.  They are essentially any option not tied to a
particular test or group of tests.  An example of a global
command-line option is the one which sets the test type - <span class="option">-t</span>.

   <p>The second type of options are test-specific options.  These are
options which are only applicable to a particular test or set of
tests.  An example of a test-specific option would be the send socket
buffer size for a TCP_STREAM test.

   <p>Global command-line options are specified first with test-specific
options following after a <code>--</code> as in:

<pre class="example">     netperf &lt;global&gt; -- &lt;test-specific&gt;
</pre>

<h2 class="chapter">2 Installing Netperf</h2>

<p><a name="index-chapter_002c-Installing-Netperf-2"></a>
Netperf's primary form of distribution is source code.  This allows
installation on systems other than those to which the authors have
ready access and thus the ability to create binaries.  There are two
styles of netperf installation.  The first runs the netperf server
program - netserver - as a child of inetd.  This requires the
installer to have sufficient privileges to edit the files
<span class="file">/etc/services</span> and <span class="file">/etc/inetd.conf</span> or their
platform-specific equivalents.

   <p>The second style is to run netserver as a standalone daemon.  This
second method does not require edit privileges on <span class="file">/etc/services</span>
and <span class="file">/etc/inetd.conf</span> but does mean you must remember to run the
netserver program explicitly after every system reboot.

   <p>This manual assumes that those wishing to measure networking
performance already know how to use anonymous FTP and/or a web
browser. It is also expected that you have at least a passing
familiarity with the networking protocols and interfaces involved. In
all honesty, if you do not have such familiarity, likely as not you
have some experience to gain before attempting network performance
measurements.  The excellent texts by authors such as Stevens, Fenner
and Rudoff and/or Stallings would be good starting points. There are
likely other excellent sources out there as well.

<p>Gzipped tar files of netperf sources can be retrieved via
<a href="ftp://ftp.cup.hp.com/dist/networking/benchmarks/netperf/">anonymous FTP</a>
for &ldquo;released&rdquo; versions of the bits.  Pre-release versions of the
bits can be retrieved via anonymous FTP from the
<a href="ftp://ftp.cup.hp.com/dist/networking/benchmarks/netperf/experimental/">experimental</a> subdirectory.

   <p>For convenience and ease of remembering, a link to the download site
is provided via the
<a href="http://www.netperf.org/">NetperfPage</a>

   <p>There are likely other places around the Internet from which one can
download netperf bits.  These may be simple mirrors of the main
netperf site, or they may be local variants on netperf.  As with
anything one downloads from the Internet, take care to make sure it is
what you really wanted and isn't some malicious Trojan or whatnot. 
Caveat downloader.

   <p>As a general rule, binaries of netperf and netserver are not
distributed from ftp.cup.hp.com.  From time to time a kind soul or
souls has packaged netperf as a Debian package available via the
apt-get mechanism.  I would be most interested in learning how to
enhance the makefiles to make that easier for people, and perhaps to
generate RPM's and HP-UX swinstall&ldquo;depots.&rdquo;

<h3 class="section">2.2 Installing Netperf</h3>

<p>Once you have downloaded the tar file of netperf sources onto your
system(s), it is necessary to unpack the tar file, cd to the netperf
directory, run configure and then make.  Most of the time it should be
sufficient to just:

<pre class="example">     gzcat &lt;netperf-version&gt;.tar.gz | tar xf -
     cd &lt;netperf-version&gt;
     ./configure
     make
     make install
</pre>
   <p>Most of the &ldquo;usual&rdquo; configure script options should be present
dealing with where to install binaries and whatnot.
<pre class="example">     ./configure --help
</pre>
   <p>should list all of those and more.

   <p>If the netperf configure script does not know how to automagically
detect which CPU utilization mechanism to use on your platform you may
want to add a <code>--enable-cpuutil=mumble</code> option to the configure
command.   If you have knowledge and/or experience to contribute to
that area, feel free to contact <a href="mailto:netperf-feedback@netperf.org">netperf-feedback@netperf.org</a>.

   <p>Similarly, if you want tests using the XTI interface, Unix Domain
Sockets, DLPI or SCTP it will be necessary to add one or more
<code>--enable-[xti|unix|dlpi|sctp]=yes</code> options to the configure
command.  As of this writing, the configure script will not include
those tests automagically.

   <p>On some platforms, it may be necessary to precede the configure
command with a CFLAGS and/or LIBS variable as the netperf configure
script is not yet smart enough to set them itself.  Whenever possible,
these requirements will be found in <span class="file">README.</span><var>platform</var> files. 
Expertise and assistance in making that more automagical in the
configure script would be most welcome.

   <p>Other optional configure-time settings include
<code>--enable-intervals=yes</code> to give netperf the ability to &ldquo;pace&rdquo;
its _STREAM tests and <code>--enable-histogram=yes</code> to have netperf
keep a histogram of interesting times.  Each of these will have some
effect on the measured result.  If your system supports
<code>gethrtime()</code> the effect of the histogram measurement should be
minimized but probably still measurable.  For example, the histogram
of a netperf TCP_RR test will be of the individual transaction times:
<pre class="example">     netperf -t TCP_RR -H lag -v 2
     TCP REQUEST/RESPONSE TEST from 0.0.0.0 (0.0.0.0) port 0 AF_INET to lag.hpl.hp.com (15.4.89.214) port 0 AF_INET : histogram

</pre>
   <p>Long-time users of netperf will notice the expansion of the main test
header.  This stems from the merging-in of IPv6 with the standard IPv4
tests and the addition of code to specify addressing information for
both sides of the data connection.

   <p>The histogram you see above is basically a base-10 log histogram where
we can see that most of the transaction times were on the order of one
hundred to one-hundred, ninety-nine microseconds, but they were
occasionally as long as ten to nineteen milliseconds

   <p>The <span class="option">--enable-demo=yes</span> configure option will cause code to be
included to report interim results during a test run.  The rate at
which interim results are reported can then be controlled via the
global <span class="option">-D</span> option.  Here is an example of &ndash;enable-demo mode
output:

<pre class="example">     src/netperf -D 1.35 -H lag -f M
     TCP STREAM TEST from 0.0.0.0 (0.0.0.0) port 0 AF_INET to lag.hpl.hp.com (15.4.89.214) port 0 AF_INET : demo
     Interim result:    9.66 MBytes/s over 1.67 seconds
     Interim result:    9.64 MBytes/s over 1.35 seconds
     Interim result:    9.58 MBytes/s over 1.36 seconds
     Interim result:    9.51 MBytes/s over 1.36 seconds
     Interim result:    9.71 MBytes/s over 1.35 seconds
     Interim result:    9.66 MBytes/s over 1.36 seconds
     Interim result:    9.61 MBytes/s over 1.36 seconds

      32768  16384  16384    10.00       9.61
</pre>
   <p>Notice how the units of the interim result track that requested by the
<span class="option">-f</span> option.  Also notice that sometimes the interval will be
longer than the value specified in the <span class="option">-D</span> option.  This is
normal and stems from how demo mode is implemented without relying on
interval timers, but by calculating how many units of work must be
performed to take at least the desired interval.

   <p>As of this writing, a <code>make install</code> will not actually update the
files <span class="file">/etc/services</span> and/or <span class="file">/etc/inetd.conf</span> or their
platform-specific equivalents.  It remains necessary to perform that
bit of installation magic by hand.  Patches to the makefile sources to
effect an automagic editing of the necessary files to have netperf
installed as a child of inetd would be most welcome.

   <p>Starting the netserver as a standalone daemon should be as easy as:
<pre class="example">     $ netserver
     Starting netserver at port 12865
     Starting netserver at hostname 0.0.0.0 port 12865 and family 0
</pre>
   <p>Over time the specifics of the messages netserver prints to the screen
may change but the gist will remain the same.

   <p>If the compilation of netperf or netserver happens to fail, feel free
to contact <a href="mailto:netperf-feedback@netperf.org">netperf-feedback@netperf.org</a> or join and ask in
<a href="mailto:netperf-talk@netperf.org">netperf-talk@netperf.org</a>.  However, it is quite important
that you include the actual compilation errors and perhaps even the
configure log in your email.  Otherwise, it will be that much more
difficult for someone to assist you.

<h2 class="chapter">3 The Design of Netperf</h2>

<p><a name="index-chapter_002c-The-Design-of-Netperf-3"></a>
Netperf is designed around a basic client-server model.  There are
two executables - netperf and netserver.  Generally you will only
execute the netperf program, with the netserver program being invoked
by the remote system's inetd or equivalent. 
When you execute netperf, the first that that will happen is the
establishment of a control connection to the remote system.  This
connection will be used to pass test configuration information and
results to and from the remote system.  Regardless of the type of test
to be run, the control connection will be a TCP connection using BSD
sockets.  The control connection can use either IPv4 or IPv6.

   <p>Once the control connection is up and the configuration information
has been passed, a separate &ldquo;data&rdquo; connection will be opened for the
measurement itself using the API's and protocols appropriate for the
specified test.  When the test is completed, the data connection will
be torn-down and results from the netserver will be passed-back via the
control connection and combined with netperf's result for display to
the user.

   <p>Netperf places no traffic on the control connection while a test is in
progress.  Certain TCP options, such as SO_KEEPALIVE, if set as your
systems' default, may put packets out on the control connection while
a test is in progress.  Generally speaking this will have no effect on
the results.

<h3 class="section">3.1 CPU Utilization</h3>

<p>CPU utilization is an important, and alas all-too infrequently
reported component of networking performance.  Unfortunately, it can
be one of the most difficult metrics to measure accurately as many
systems offer mechanisms that are at best il-suited to measuring CPU
utilization in high interrupt rate (eg networking) situations.

   <p>CPU utilization in netperf is reported as a value between 0 and 100%
regardless of the number of CPUs involved.  In addition to CPU
utilization, netperf will report a metric called a <dfn>service
demand</dfn>.  The service demand is the normalization of CPU utilization
and work performed.  For a _STREAM test it is the microseconds of CPU
time consumed to transfer on KB (K == 1024) of data.  For a _RR test
it is the microseconds of CPU time consumed processing a single
transaction.   For both CPU utilization and service demand, lower is
better.

   <p>Service demand can be particularly useful when trying to gauge the
effect of a performance change.  It is essentially a measure of
efficiency, with smaller values being more efficient.

   <p>Netperf is coded to be able to use one of several, generally
platform-specific CPU utilization measurement mechanisms.  Single
letter codes will be included in the CPU portion of the test banner to
indicate which mechanism was used on each of the local (netperf) and
remote (netserver) system.

   <p>As of this writing those codes are:

     <dl>
<dt><code>U</code><dd>The CPU utilization measurement mechanism was unknown to netperf or
netperf/netserver was not compiled to include CPU utilization
measurements. The code for the null CPU utilization mechanism can be
found in <span class="file">src/netcpu_none.c</span>. 
<br><dt><code>I</code><dd>An HP-UX-specific CPU utilization mechanism whereby the kernel
incremented a per-CPU counter by one for each trip through the idle
loop. This mechanism was only available on specially-compiled HP-UX
kernels prior to HP-UX 10 and is mentioned here only for the sake of
historical completeness and perhaps as a suggestion to those who might
be altering other operating systems. While rather simple, perhaps even
simplistic, this mechanism was quite robust and was not affected by
the concerns of statistical methods, or methods attempting to track
time in each of user, kernel, interrupt and idle modes which require
quite careful accounting.  It can be thought-of as the in-kernel
version of the looper <code>L</code> mechanism without the context switch
overhead. This mechanism required calibration. 
<br><dt><code>P</code><dd>An HP-UX-specific CPU utilization mechanism whereby the kernel
keeps-track of time (in the form of CPU cycles) spent in the kernel
idle loop (HP-UX 10.0 to 11.23 inclusive), or where the kernel keeps
track of time spent in idle, user, kernel and interrupt processing
(HP-UX 11.23 and later).  The former requires calibration, the latter
does not.  Values in either case are retrieved via one of the pstat(2)
family of calls, hence the use of the letter <code>P</code>.  The code for
these mechanisms is found in <span class="file">src/netcpu_pstat.c</span> and
<span class="file">src/netcpu_pstatnew.c</span> respectively. 
<br><dt><code>K</code><dd>A Solaris-specific CPU utilization mechanism where by the kernel
keeps track of ticks (eg HZ) spent in the idle loop.  This method is
statistical and is known to be inaccurate when the interrupt rate is
above epsilon as time spent processing interrupts is not subtracted
from idle.  The value is retrieved via a kstat() call - hence the use
of the letter <code>K</code>.  Since this mechanism uses units of ticks (HZ)
the calibration value should invariably match HZ. (Eg 100)  The code
for this mechanism is implemented in <span class="file">src/netcpu_kstat.c</span>. 
<br><dt><code>M</code><dd>A Solaris-specific mechanism available on Solaris 10 and latter which
uses the new microstate accounting mechanisms.  There are two, alas,
overlapping, mechanisms.  The first tracks nanoseconds spent in user,
kernel, and idle modes. The second mechanism tracks nanoseconds spent
in interrupt.  Since the mechanisms overlap, netperf goes through some
hand-waving to try to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the problem.  Since the accuracy of the
handwaving cannot be completely determined, one must presume that
while better than the <code>K</code> mechanism, this mechanism too is not
without issues.  The values are retrieved via kstat() calls, but the
letter code is set to <code>M</code> to distinguish this mechanism from the
even less accurate <code>K</code> mechanism.  The code for this mechanism is
implemented in <span class="file">src/netcpu_kstat10.c</span>. 
<br><dt><code>L</code><dd>A mechanism based on &ldquo;looper&rdquo;or &ldquo;soaker&rdquo; processes which sit in
tight loops counting as fast as they possibly can. This mechanism
starts a looper process for each known CPU on the system.  The effect
of processor hyperthreading on the mechanism is not yet known.  This
mechanism definitely requires calibration.  The code for the
&ldquo;looper&rdquo;mechanism can be found in <span class="file">src/netcpu_looper.c</span>
<br><dt><code>N</code><dd>A Microsoft Windows-specific mechanism, the code for which can be
found in <span class="file">src/netcpu_ntperf.c</span>.  This mechanism too is based on
what appears to be a form of micro-state accounting and requires no
calibration.  On laptops, or other systems which may dynamically alter
the CPU frequency to minimize power consumtion, it has been suggested
that this mechanism may become slightly confsed, in which case using
BIOS settings to disable the power saving would be indicated.

     <br><dt><code>S</code><dd>This mechanism uses <span class="file">/proc/stat</span> on Linux to retrieve time
(ticks) spent in idle mode.  It is thought but not known to be
reasonably accurate.  The code for this mechanism can be found in
<span class="file">src/netcpu_procstat.c</span>. 
<br><dt><code>C</code><dd>A mechanism somewhat similar to <code>S</code> but using the sysctl() call
on BSD-like Operating systems (*BSD and MacOS X).  The code for this
mechanism can be found in <span class="file">src/netcpu_sysctl.c</span>. 
<br><dt><code>Others</code><dd>Other mechanisms included in netperf in the past have included using
the times() and getrusage() calls.  These calls are actually rather
poorly suited to the task of measuring CPU overhead for networking as
they tend to be process-specific and much network-related  processing
can happen outside the context of a process, in places where it is not
a given it will be charged to the correct, or even a process.  They
are mentioned here as a warning to anyone seeing those mechanisms used
in other networking benchmarks.  These mechanisms are not available in
netperf 2.4.0 and later. 
</dl>

   <p>For many platforms, the configure script will chose the best available
CPU utilization mechanism.  However, some platforms have no
particularly good mechanisms.  On those platforms, it is probably best
to use the &ldquo;LOOPER&rdquo; mechanism which is basically some number of
processes (as many as there are processors) sitting in tight little
loops counting as fast as they can.  The rate at which the loopers
count when the system is believed to be idle is compared with the rate
when the system is running netperf and the ratio is used to compute
CPU utilization.

   <p>In the past, netperf included some mechanisms that only reported CPU
time charged to the calling process.  Those mechanisms have been
removed from netperf versions 2.4.0 and later because they are
hopelessly inaccurate.  Networking can and often results in CPU time
being spent in places - such as interrupt contexts - that do not get
charged to a or the correct process.

   <p>In fact, time spent in the processing of interrupts is a common issue
for many CPU utilization mechanisms.  In particular, the &ldquo;PSTAT&rdquo;
mechanism was eventually known to have problems accounting for certain
interrupt time prior to HP-UX 11.11 (11iv1).  HP-UX 11iv1 and later
are known to be good. The &ldquo;KSTAT&rdquo; mechanism is known to have
problems on all versions of Solaris up to and including Solaris 10. 
Even the microstate accounting available via kstat in Solaris 10 has
issues, though perhaps not as bad as those of prior versions.

   <p>The /proc/stat mechanism under Linux is in what the author would
consider an &ldquo;uncertain&rdquo; category as it appears to be statistical,
which may also have issues with time spent processing interrupts.

   <p>In summary, be sure to &ldquo;sanity-check&rdquo; the CPU utilization figures
with other mechanisms.  However, platform tools such as top, vmstat or
mpstat are often based on the same mechanisms used by netperf.

<p>This section describes each of the global command-line options

an expanded version of the usage information displayed by netperf or
netserver when invoked with the <span class="option">-h</span> global command-line
option.

<h3 class="section">4.1 Command-line Options Syntax</h3>

<p>Revision 1.8 of netperf introduced enough new functionality to overrun
the English alphabet for mnemonic command-line option names, and the
author was not and is not quite ready to switch to the contemporary
<span class="option">--mumble</span> style of command-line options. (Call him a Luddite).

   <p>For this reason, the command-line options were split into two parts -
the first are the global command-line options.  They are options that
affect nearly any and every test type of netperf.  The second type are
the test-specific command-line options.  Both are entered on the same
command line, but they must be separated from one another by a <code>--</code>
for correct parsing.  Global command-line options come first, followed
by the <code>--</code> and then test-specific command-line options.  If there
are no test-specific options to be set, the <code>--</code> may be omitted.  If
there are no global command-line options to be set, test-specific
options must still be preceded by a <code>--</code>.  For example:
<pre class="example">     netperf &lt;global&gt; -- &lt;test-specific&gt;
</pre>
   <p>sets both global and test-specific options:
<pre class="example">     netperf &lt;global&gt;
</pre>
   <p>sets just global options and:
<pre class="example">     netperf -- &lt;test-specific&gt;
</pre>
   <p>sets just test-specific options.

<h3 class="section">4.2 Global Options</h3>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-a &lt;sizespec&gt;</code><dd>This option allows you to alter the alignment of the buffers used in
the sending and receiving calls on the local system.. Changing the
alignment of the buffers can force the system to use different copy
schemes, which can have a measurable effect on performance.  If the
page size for the system were 4096 bytes, and you want to pass
page-aligned buffers beginning on page boundaries, you could use
<span class="samp">-a 4096</span>.  By default the units are bytes, but suffix of &ldquo;G,&rdquo;
&ldquo;M,&rdquo; or &ldquo;K&rdquo; will specify the units to be 2^30 (GB), 2^20 (MB) or
2^10 (KB) respectively. A suffix of &ldquo;g,&rdquo; &ldquo;m&rdquo; or &ldquo;k&rdquo; will specify
units of 10^9, 10^6 or 10^3 bytes respectively. [Default: 8 bytes]

     <br><dt><code>-A &lt;sizespec&gt;</code><dd>This option is identical to the <span class="option">-a</span> option with the difference
being it affects alignments for the remote system.

     <br><dt><code>-b &lt;size&gt;</code><dd>This option is only present when netperf has been configure with
&ndash;enable-intervals=yes prior to compilation.  It sets the size of the
burst of send calls in a _STREAM test.  When used in conjunction with
the <span class="option">-w</span> option it can cause the rate at which data is sent to
be &ldquo;paced.&rdquo;

     <br><dt><code>-c [rate]</code><dd>This option will ask that CPU utilization and service demand be
calculated for the local system.  For those CPU utilization mechanisms
requiring calibration, the options rate parameter may be specified to
preclude running another calibration step, saving 40 seconds of time. 
For those CPU utilization mechanisms requiring no calibration, the
optional rate parameter will be utterly and completely ignored. 
[Default: no CPU measurements]

     <br><dt><code>-C [rate]</code><dd>This option requests CPU utilization and service demand calculations
for the remote system.  It is otherwise identical to the <span class="option">-c</span>
option.

     <br><dt><code>-d</code><dd>Each instance of this option will increase the quantity of debugging
output displayed during a test.  If the debugging output level is set
high enough, it may have a measurable effect on performance. 
Debugging information for the local system is printed to stdout. 
Debugging information for the remote system is sent by default to the
file <span class="file">/tmp/netperf.debug</span>. [Default: no debugging output]

     <br><dt><code>-D [interval,units]</code><dd>This option is only available when netperf is configured with
&ndash;enable-demo=yes.  When set, it will cause netperf to emit periodic
reports of performance during the run.  [<var>interval</var>,<var>units</var>]
follow the semantics of an optionspec. If specified,
<var>interval</var> gives the minimum interval in real seconds, it does not
have to be whole seconds.  The <var>units</var> value can be used for the
first guess as to how many units of work (bytes or transactions) must
be done to take at least <var>interval</var> seconds. If omitted,
<var>interval</var> defaults to one second and <var>units</var> to values
specific to each test type.

     <br><dt><code>-f G|M|K|g|m|k</code><dd>This option can be used to change the reporting units for _STREAM
tests.  Arguments of &ldquo;G,&rdquo; &ldquo;M,&rdquo; or &ldquo;K&rdquo; will set the units to
2^30, 2^20 or 2^10 bytes/s respectively (EG power of two GB, MB or
KB).  Arguments of &ldquo;g,&rdquo; &ldquo;,m&rdquo; or &ldquo;k&rdquo; will set the units to 10^9,
10^6 or 10^3 bits/s respectively.  [Default: 'm' or 10^6 bits/s]

     <br><dt><code>-F &lt;fillfile&gt;</code><dd>This option specified the file from which send which buffers will be
pre-filled .  While the buffers will contain data from the specified
file, the file is not fully transfered to the remote system as the
receiving end of the test will not write the contents of what it
receives to a file.  This can be used to pre-fill the send buffers
with data having different compressibility and so is useful when
measuring performance over mechanisms which perform compression.

     <p>While optional for most tests, this option is required for a test
utilizing the sendfile() or related calls because sendfile tests need
a name of a file to reference.

     <br><dt><code>-h</code><dd>This option causes netperf to display its usage string and exit to the
exclusion of all else.

     <br><dt><code>-H &lt;optionspec&gt;</code><dd>This option will set the name of the remote system and or the address
family used for the control connection.  For example:
     <pre class="example">          -H linger,4
     </pre>
     <p>will set the name of the remote system to &ldquo;tardy&rdquo; and tells netperf to
use IPv4 addressing only.
     <pre class="example">          -H ,6
     </pre>
     <p>will leave the name of the remote system at its default, and request
that only IPv6 addresses be used for the control connection.
     <pre class="example">          -H lag
     </pre>
     <p>will set the name of the remote system to &ldquo;lag&rdquo; and leave the
address family to AF_UNSPEC which means selection of IPv4 vs IPv6 is
left to the system's address resolution.

     <p>A value of &ldquo;inet&rdquo; can be used in place of &ldquo;4&rdquo; to request IPv4 only
addressing.  Similarly, a value of &ldquo;inet6&rdquo; can be used in place of
&ldquo;6&rdquo; to request IPv6 only addressing.  A value of &ldquo;0&rdquo; can be used
to request either IPv4 or IPv6 addressing as name resolution dictates.

     <p>By default, the options set with the global <span class="option">-H</span> option are
inherited by the test for their data connections, unless a
test-specific <span class="option">-H</span> option is specified.

     <p>If a <span class="option">-H</span> option follows either the <span class="option">-4</span> or <span class="option">-6</span>
options, the family setting specified with the -H option will override
the <span class="option">-4</span> or <span class="option">-6</span> options for the remote address
family. If no address family is specified, settings from a previous
<span class="option">-4</span> or <span class="option">-6</span> option will remain.  In a nutshell, the
last explicit global command-line option wins.

     <p>[Default:  &ldquo;localhost&rdquo; for the remote name/IP address and &ldquo;0&rdquo; (eg
AF_UNSPEC) for the remote address family.]

     <br><dt><code>-L &lt;optionspec&gt;</code><dd>This option is identical to the <span class="option">-H</span> option with the difference
being it sets the _local_ hostname/IP and/or address family
information.  This option is generally unnecessary, but can be useful
when you wish to make sure that the netperf control and data
connections go via different paths.  It can also come-in handy if one
is trying to run netperf through those evil, end-to-end breaking
things known as firewalls.

     <p>[Default: 0.0.0.0 (eg INADDR_ANY) for IPv4 and ::0 for IPv6 for the
local name.  AF_UNSPEC for the local address family.]

     <br><dt><code>-I &lt;optionspec&gt;</code><dd>This option enables the calculation of confidence intervals and sets
the confidence and width parameters with the first have of the
optionspec being either 99 or 95 for 99% or 95% confidence
respectively.  The second value of the optionspec specifies the width
of the desired confidence interval.  For example
     <pre class="example">          -I 99,5
     </pre>
     <p>asks netperf to be 99% confident that the measured mean values for
throughput and CPU utilization are within +/- 2.5% of the &ldquo;real&rdquo;
mean values.  If the <span class="option">-i</span> option is specified and the
<span class="option">-I</span> option is omitted, the confidence defaults to 99% and the
width to 5% (giving +/- 2.5%)

     <p>If netperf calculates that the desired confidence intervals have not
been met, it emits a noticeable warning that cannot be suppressed with
the <span class="option">-P</span> or <span class="option">-v</span> options:

     <pre class="example">          netperf -H tardy.cup -i 3 -I 99,5
          TCP STREAM TEST from 0.0.0.0 (0.0.0.0) port 0 AF_INET to tardy.cup.hp.com (15.244.44.58) port 0 AF_INET : +/-2.5%  99% conf.

     </pre>
     <p>Where we see that netperf did not meet the desired convidence
intervals.  Instead of being 99% confident it was within +/- 2.5% of
the real mean value of throughput it is only confident it was within
+/-3.4%.  In this example, increasing the <span class="option">-i</span> option
(described below) and/or increasing the iteration length with the
<span class="option">-l</span> option might resolve the situation.

     <br><dt><code>-i &lt;sizespec&gt;</code><dd>This option enables the calculation of confidence intervals and sets
the minimum and maximum number of iterations to run in attempting to
achieve the desired confidence interval.  The first value sets the
maximum number of iterations to run, the second, the minimum.  The
maximum number of iterations is silently capped at 30 and the minimum
is silently floored at 3.  Netperf repeats the measurement the minimum
number of iterations and continues until it reaches either the
desired confidence interval, or the maximum number of iterations,
whichever comes first.

     <p>If the <span class="option">-I</span> option is specified and the <span class="option">-i</span> option
omitted the maximum number of iterations is set to 10 and the minimum
to three.

     <p>If netperf determines that the desired confidence intervals have not
been met, it emits a noticeable warning.

     <br><dt><code>-l testlen</code><dd>This option controls the length of any one iteration of the requested
test.  A positive value for <var>testlen</var> will run each iteration of
the test for at least <var>testlen</var> seconds.  A negative value for
<var>testlen</var> will run each iteration for the absolute value of
<var>testlen</var> transactions for a _RR test or bytes for a _STREAM test. 
Certain tests, notably those using UDP can only be timed, they cannot
be limited by transaction or byte count.

     <p>In some situations, individual iterations of a test may run for longer
for the number of seconds specified by the <span class="option">-l</span> option.  In
particular, this may occur for those tests where the socket buffer
size(s) are significantly longer than the bandwidthXdelay product of
the link(s) over which the data connection passes, or those tests
where there may be non-trivial numbers of retransmissions.

     <br><dt><code>-n numcpus</code><dd>This option tells netperf how many CPUs it should ass-u-me are active
on the system running netperf.  In particular, this is used for the
<a href="#CPU-Utilization">CPU utilization</a> and service demand calculations. 
On certain systems, netperf is able to determine the number of CPU's
automagically. This option will override any number netperf might be
able to determine on its own.

     <p>Note that this option does _not_ set the number of CPUs on the system
running netserver.  When netperf/netserver cannot automagically
determine the number of CPUs that can only be set for netserver via a
netserver <span class="option">-n</span> command-line option.

     <br><dt><code>-o &lt;sizespec&gt;</code><dd>The value(s) passed-in with this option will be used as an offset
added to the alignment specified with the <span class="option">-a</span> option.  For
example:
     <pre class="example">          -o 3 -a 4096
     </pre>
     <p>will cause the buffers passed to the local send and receive calls to
begin three bytes past an address aligned to 4096 bytes. [Default: 0
bytes]

     <br><dt><code>-O &lt;sizespec&gt;</code><dd>This option behaves just as the <span class="option">-o</span> option by on the remote
system and in conjunction with the <span class="option">-A</span> option. [Default: 0
bytes]

     <br><dt><code>-p &lt;optionspec&gt;</code><dd>The first value of the optionspec passed-in with this option tells
netperf the port number at which it should expect the remote netserver
to be listening for control connections.  The second value of the
optionspec will request netperf to bind to that local port number
before establishing the control connection.  For example
     <pre class="example">          -p 12345
     </pre>
     <p>tells netperf that the remote netserver is listening on port 12345 and
leaves selection of the local port number for the control connection
up to the local TCP/IP stack whereas
     <pre class="example">          -p ,32109
     </pre>
     <p>leaves the remote netserver port at the default value of 12865 and
causes netperf to bind to the local port number 32109 before
connecting to the remote netserver.

     <p>In general, setting the local port number is only necessary when one
is looking to run netperf through those evil, end-to-end breaking
things known as firewalls.

     <br><dt><code>-P 0|1</code><dd>A value of &ldquo;1&rdquo; for the <span class="option">-P</span> option will enable display of
the test banner.  A value of &ldquo;0&rdquo; will disable display of the test
banner. One might want to disable display of the test banner when
running the same basic test type (eg TCP_STREAM) multiple times in
succession where the test banners would then simply be redundant and
unnecessarily clutter the output. [Default: 1 - display test banners]

     <br><dt><code>-t testname</code><dd>This option is used to tell netperf which test you wish to run.  As of
this writing, valid values for <var>testname</var> include:
          <ul>
<li><a href="#TCP_005fSTREAM">TCP_STREAM</a>, <a href="#TCP_005fMAERTS">TCP_MAERTS</a>, <a href="#TCP_005fSENDFILE">TCP_SENDFILE</a>, <a href="#TCP_005fRR">TCP_RR</a>, <a href="#TCP_005fCRR">TCP_CRR</a>, <a href="#TCP_005fCC">TCP_CC</a>

<li><a href="#Other-Netperf-Tests">LOC_CPU</a>, <a href="#Other-Netperf-Tests">REM_CPU</a>
</ul>
     Not all tests are always compiled into netperf.  In particular, the
&ldquo;XTI,&rdquo; &ldquo;SCTP,&rdquo; &ldquo;UNIX,&rdquo; and &ldquo;DL*&rdquo; tests are only included in
netperf when configured with
<span class="option">--enable-[xti|sctp|unix|dlpi]=yes</span>.

     <p>Netperf only runs one type of test no matter how many <span class="option">-t</span>
options may be present on the command-line.  The last <span class="option">-t</span>
global command-line option will determine the test to be
run. [Default: TCP_STREAM]

     <br><dt><code>-v verbosity</code><dd>This option controls how verbose netperf will be in its output, and is
often used in conjunction with the <span class="option">-P</span> option. If the
verbosity is set to a value of &ldquo;0&rdquo; then only the test's SFM (Single
Figure of Merit) is displayed.  If local <a href="#CPU-Utilization">CPU utilization</a> is requested via the <span class="option">-c</span> option then the SFM is
the local service demand.  Othersise, if remote CPU utilization is
requested via the <span class="option">-C</span> option then the SFM is the remote
service demand.  If neither local nor remote CPU utilization are
requested the SFM will be the measured throughput or transaction rate
as implied by the test specified with the <span class="option">-t</span> option.

     <p>If the verbosity level is set to &ldquo;1&rdquo; then the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; netperf
result output for each test is displayed.

     <p>If the verbosity level is set to &ldquo;2&rdquo; then &ldquo;extra&rdquo; information will
be displayed.  This may include, but is not limited to the number of
send or recv calls made and the average number of bytes per send or
recv call, or a histogram of the time spent in each send() call or for
each transaction if netperf was configured with
<span class="option">--enable-histogram=yes</span>. [Default: 1 - normal verbosity]

     <br><dt><code>-w time</code><dd>If netperf was configured with <span class="option">--enable-intervals=yes</span> then
this value will set the inter-burst time to time milliseconds, and the
<span class="option">-b</span> option will set the number of sends per burst.  The actual
inter-burst time may vary depending on the system's timer resolution.

     <br><dt><code>-W &lt;sizespec&gt;</code><dd>This option controls the number of buffers in the send (first or only
value) and or receive (second or only value) buffer rings.  Unlike
some benchmarks, netperf does not continuously send or receive from a
single buffer.  Instead it rotates through a ring of
buffers. [Default: One more than the size of the send or receive
socket buffer sizes (<span class="option">-s</span> and/or <span class="option">-S</span> options) divided
by the send <span class="option">-m</span> or receive <span class="option">-M</span> buffer size
respectively]

     <br><dt><code>-4</code><dd>Specifying this option will set both the local and remote address
families to AF_INET - that is use only IPv4 addresses on the control
connection.  This can be overridden by a subsequent <span class="option">-6</span>,
<span class="option">-H</span> or <span class="option">-L</span> option.  Basically, the last option
explicitly specifying an address family wins.  Unless overridden by a
test-specific option, this will be inherited for the data connection
as well.

     <br><dt><code>-6</code><dd>Specifying this option will set both local and and remote address
families to AF_INET6 - that is use only IPv6 addresses on the control
connection.  This can be overridden by a subsequent <span class="option">-4</span>,
<span class="option">-H</span> or <span class="option">-L</span> option.  Basically, the last address family
explicitly specified wins.  Unless overridden by a test-specific
option, this will be inherited for the data connection as well.

<h2 class="chapter">5 Using Netperf to Measure Bulk Data Transfer</h2>

<p>The most commonly measured aspect of networked system performance is
that of bulk or unidirectional transfer performance.  Everyone wants
to know how many bits or bytes per second they can push across the
network. The netperf convention for a bulk data transfer test name is
to tack a &ldquo;_STREAM&rdquo; suffix to a test name.

<h3 class="section">5.1 Issues in Bulk Transfer</h3>

<p>There are any number of things which can affect the performance of a
bulk transfer test.

   <p>Certainly, absent compression, bulk-transfer tests can be limited by
the speed of the slowest link in the path from the source to the
destination.  If testing over a gigabit link, you will not see more
than a gigabit :) Such situations can be described as being
<dfn>network-limited</dfn> or <dfn>NIC-limited</dfn>.

   <p>CPU utilization can also affect the results of a bulk-transfer test. 
If the networking stack requires a certain number of instructions or
CPU cycles per KB of data transferred, and the CPU is limited in the
number of instructions or cycles it can provide, then the transfer can
be described as being <dfn>CPU-bound</dfn>.

   <p>A bulk-transfer test can be CPU bound even when netperf reports less
than 100% CPU utilization.  This can happen on an MP system where one
or more of the CPUs saturate at 100% but other CPU's remain idle. 
Typically, a single flow of data, such as that from a single instance
of a netperf _STREAM test cannot make use of much more than the power
of one CPU.

   <p>Distance and the speed-of-light can affect performance for a
bulk-transfer; often this can be mitigated by using larger windows. 
One common limit to the performance of a transport using window-based
flow-control is:
<pre class="example">     Throughput &lt;= WindowSize/RoundTripTime
</pre>
   <p>As the sender can only have a window's-worth of data outstanding on
the network at any one time, and the soonest the sender can receive a
window update from the receiver is one RoundTripTime (RTT).  TCP and
SCTP are examples of such protocols.

   <p>Packet losses and their effects can be particularly bad for
performance.  This is especially true if the packet losses result in
retransmission timeouts for the protocol(s) involved.  By the time a
retransmission timeout has happened, the flow or connection has sat
idle for a considerable length of time.

   <p>On many platforms, some variant on the <span class="command">netstat</span> command can
be used to retrieve statistics about packet loss and
retransmission. For example:
<pre class="example">     netstat -p tcp
</pre>
   <p>will retrieve TCP statistics on the HP-UX Operating System.  On other
platforms, it may not be possible to retrieve statistics for a
specific protocol and something like:
<pre class="example">     netstat -s
</pre>
   <p>would be used instead.

   <p>Many times, such network statistics are keep since the time the stack
started, and we are only really interested in statistics from when
netperf was running.  In such situations something along the lines of:
<pre class="example">     netstat -p tcp &gt; before
     netperf -t TCP_mumble...
     netstat -p tcp &gt; after
</pre>
   <p>is indicated.  The
<a href="ftp://ftp.cup.hp.com/dist/networking/tools/">beforeafter</a> utility
can be used to subtract the statistics in <span class="file">before</span> from the
statistics in <span class="file">after</span>
<pre class="example">     beforeafter before after &gt; delta
</pre>
   <p>and then one can look at the statistics in <span class="file">delta</span>.  While it was
written with HP-UX's netstat in mind, the
<a href="ftp://ftp.cup.hp.com/dist/networking/briefs/annotated_netstat.txt">annotated netstat</a> writeup may be helpful with other platforms as well.

<h3 class="section">5.2 Options common to TCP UDP and SCTP tests</h3>

<p>Many &ldquo;test-specific&rdquo; options are actually common across the
different tests.  For those tests involving TCP, UDP and SCTP, whether
using the BSD Sockets or the XTI interface those common options
include:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-h</code><dd>Display the test-suite-specific usage string and exit.  For a TCP_ or
UDP_ test this will be the usage string from the source file
nettest_bsd.c.  For an XTI_ test, this will be the usage string from
the source file nettest_xti.c.  For an SCTP test, this will be the
usage string from the source file nettest_sctp.c.

     <br><dt><code>-H &lt;optionspec&gt;</code><dd>Normally, the remote hostname|IP and address family information is
inherited from the settings for the control connection (eg global
command-line <span class="option">-H</span>, <span class="option">-4</span> and/or <span class="option">-6</span> options). 
The test-specific <span class="option">-H</span> will override those settings for the
data (aka test) connection only.  Settings for the control connection
are left unchanged.

     <br><dt><code>-L &lt;optionspec&gt;</code><dd>The test-specific <span class="option">-L</span> option is identical to the test-specific
<span class="option">-H</span> option except it affects the local hostname|IP and address
family information.  As with its global command-line counterpart, this
is generally only useful when measuring though those evil, end-to-end
breaking things called firewalls.

     <br><dt><code>-m bytes</code><dd>Set the size of the buffer passed-in to the &ldquo;send&rdquo; calls of a
_STREAM test.  Note that this may have only an indirect effect on the
size of the packets sent over the network, and certain Layer 4
protocols do _not_ preserve or enforce message boundaries, so setting
<span class="option">-m</span> for the send size does not necessarily mean the receiver
will receive that many bytes at any one time. By default the units are
bytes, but suffix of &ldquo;G,&rdquo; &ldquo;M,&rdquo; or &ldquo;K&rdquo; will specify the units to
be 2^30 (GB), 2^20 (MB) or 2^10 (KB) respectively. A suffix of &ldquo;g,&rdquo;
&ldquo;m&rdquo; or &ldquo;k&rdquo; will specify units of 10^9, 10^6 or 10^3 bytes
respectively. For example:
     <pre class="example">          <code>-m 32K</code>
     </pre>
     <p>will set the size to 32KB or 32768 bytes. [Default: the local send
socket buffer size for the connection - either the system's default or
the value set via the <span class="option">-s</span> option.]

     <br><dt><code>-M bytes</code><dd>Set the size of the buffer passed-in to the &ldquo;recv&rdquo; calls of a
_STREAM test.  This will be an upper bound on the number of bytes
received per receive call. By default the units are bytes, but suffix
of &ldquo;G,&rdquo; &ldquo;M,&rdquo; or &ldquo;K&rdquo; will specify the units to be 2^30 (GB), 2^20
(MB) or 2^10 (KB) respectively.  A suffix of &ldquo;g,&rdquo; &ldquo;m&rdquo; or &ldquo;k&rdquo;
will specify units of 10^9, 10^6 or 10^3 bytes respectively. For
example:
     <pre class="example">          <code>-M 32K</code>
     </pre>
     <p>will set the size to 32KB or 32768 bytes. [Default: the remote receive
socket buffer size for the data connection - either the system's
default or the value set via the <span class="option">-S</span> option.]

     <br><dt><code>-P &lt;optionspec&gt;</code><dd>Set the local and/or remote port numbers for the data connection.

     <br><dt><code>-s &lt;sizespec&gt;</code><dd>This option sets the local send and receive socket buffer sizes for
the control connection to the value(s) specified.  Often, this will
affect the advertised and/or effective TCP or other window, but on
some platforms it may not. By default the units are bytes, but suffix
of &ldquo;G,&rdquo; &ldquo;M,&rdquo; or &ldquo;K&rdquo; will specify the units to be 2^30 (GB), 2^20
(MB) or 2^10 (KB) respectively.  A suffix of &ldquo;g,&rdquo; &ldquo;m&rdquo; or &ldquo;k&rdquo;
will specify units of 10^9, 10^6 or 10^3 bytes respectively. For
example:
     <pre class="example">          <code>-s 128K</code>
     </pre>
     <p>Will request the local send and receive socket buffer sizes to be
128KB or 131072 bytes.

     <p>While the historic expectation is that setting the socket buffer size
has a direct effect on say the TCP window, today that may not hold
true for all stacks. Further, while the historic expectation is that
the value specified in a setsockopt() call will be the value returned
via a getsockopt() call, at least one stack is known to deliberately
ignore history. [Default: 0 - use the system's default socket buffer
sizes]

     <br><dt><code>-S &lt;sizespec&gt;</code><dd>This option sets the remote send and/or receive socket buffer sizes
for the control connection to the value(s) specified.  Often, this
will affect the advertised and/or effective TCP or other window, but
on some platforms it may not. By default the units are bytes, but
suffix of &ldquo;G,&rdquo; &ldquo;M,&rdquo; or &ldquo;K&rdquo; will specify the units to be 2^30
(GB), 2^20 (MB) or 2^10 (KB) respectively.  A suffix of &ldquo;g,&rdquo; &ldquo;m&rdquo;
or &ldquo;k&rdquo; will specify units of 10^9, 10^6 or 10^3 bytes respectively. 
For example:
     <pre class="example">          <code>-s 128K</code>
     </pre>
     <p>Will request the local send and receive socket buffer sizes to be
128KB or 131072 bytes.

     <p>While the historic expectation is that setting the socket buffer size
has a direct effect on say the TCP window, today that may not hold
true for all stacks.  Further, while the historic expectation is that
the value specified in a setsockopt() call will be the value returned
via a getsockopt() call, at least one stack is known to deliberately
ignore history. [Default: 0 - use the system's default socket buffer
sizes]

     <br><dt><code>-4</code><dd>Set the local and remote address family for the data connection to
AF_INET - ie use IPv4 addressing only.  Just as with their global
command-line counterparts the last of the <span class="option">-4</span>, <span class="option">-6</span>,
<span class="option">-H</span> or <span class="option">-L</span> option wins for their respective address
families.

     <br><dt><code>-6</code><dd>This option is identical to its <span class="option">-4</span> cousin, but requests IPv6
addresses for the local and remote ends of the data connection.

<h4 class="subsection">5.2.1 TCP_STREAM</h4>

<p>The TCP_STREAM test is the default test in netperf.  It is quite
simple, transferring some quantity of data from the system running
netperf to the system running netserver.  While time spent
establishing the connection is not included in the throughput
calculation, time spent flushing the last of the data to the remote at
the end of the test is.  This is how netperf knows that all the data
it sent was received by the remote.  In addition to the <a href="#Options-common-to-TCP-UDP-and-SCTP-tests">options common to STREAM tests</a>, the
following test-specific options can be included to possibly alter the
behavior of the test:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-C</code><dd>This option will set TCP_CORK mode on the data connection on those
systems where TCP_CORK is defined (typically Linux).  A full
description of TCP_CORK is beyond the scope of this manual, but in a
nutshell it forces sub-MSS sends to be buffered so every segment sent
is Maximum Segment Size (MSS) unless the application performs an
explicit flush operation or the connection is closed.  At present
netperf does not perform an explicit flush operations.  Setting
TCP_CORK may improve the bitrate of tests where the &ldquo;send size&rdquo;
(<span class="option">-m</span> option) is smaller than the MSS.  It should also improve
(make smaller) the service demand.

     <p>The Linux tcp(7) manpage states that TCP_CORK cannot be used in
conjunction with TCP_NODELAY (set via the <span class="option">-d</span> option), however
netperf does not validate command-line options to enforce that.

     <br><dt><code>-D</code><dd>This option will set TCP_NODELAY on the data connection on those
systems where TCP_NODELAY is defined.  This disables something known
as the Nagle Algorithm, which is intended to make the segments TCP
sends as large as reasonably possible.  Setting TCP_NODELAY for a
TCP_STREAM test should either have no effect when the send size
(<span class="option">-m</span> option) is larger than the MSS or will decrease reported
bitrate and increase service demand when the send size is smaller than
the MSS.  This stems from TCP_NODELAY causing each sub-MSS send to be
its own TCP segment rather than being aggregated with other small
sends.  This means more trips up and down the protocol stack per KB of
data transferred, which means greater CPU utilization.

     <p>If setting TCP_NODELAY with <span class="option">-D</span> affects throughput and/or
service demand for tests where the send size (<span class="option">-m</span>) is larger
than the MSS it suggests the TCP/IP stack's implementation of the
Nagle Algorithm _may_ be broken, perhaps interpreting the Nagle
Algorithm on a segment by segment basis rather than the proper user
send by user send basis.  However, a better test of this can be
achieved with the <a href="#TCP_005fRR">TCP_RR</a> test.

   </dl>

   <p>Here is an example of a basic TCP_STREAM test, in this case from a
Debian Linux (2.6 kernel) system to an HP-UX 11iv2 (HP-UX 11.23)
system:

<pre class="example">     $ netperf -H lag
     TCP STREAM TEST from 0.0.0.0 (0.0.0.0) port 0 AF_INET to lag.hpl.hp.com (15.4.89.214) port 0 AF_INET
     Recv   Send    Send
     Socket Socket  Message  Elapsed
     Size   Size    Size     Time     Throughput

      32768  16384  16384    10.00      80.42
</pre>
   <p>We see that the default receive socket buffer size for the receiver
(lag - HP-UX 11.23) is 32768 bytes, and the default socket send buffer
size for the sender (Debian 2.6 kernel) is 16384 bytes.  Througput is
expressed as 10^6 (aka Mega) bits per second, and the test ran for 10
seconds.  IPv4 addresses (AF_INET) were used.

<p>A TCP_MAERTS (MAERTS is STREAM backwards) test is &ldquo;just like&rdquo; a
<a href="#TCP_005fSTREAM">TCP_STREAM</a> test except the data flows from the netserver to the
netperf. The global command-line <span class="option">-F</span> option is ignored for
this test type.  The test-specific command-line <span class="option">-C</span> option is
ignored for this test type.

   <p>Here is an example of a TCP_MAERTS test between the same two systems
as in the example for the <a href="#TCP_005fSTREAM">TCP_STREAM</a> test.  This time we request

<h4 class="subsection">5.2.3 TCP_SENDFILE</h4>

<p>The TCP_SENDFILE test is &ldquo;just like&rdquo; a <a href="#TCP_005fSTREAM">TCP_STREAM</a> test except
netperf calls the platform's equivalent to HP-UX's <code>sendfile()</code>
instead of calling <code>send()</code>.  Often this results in a
<dfn>zero-copy</dfn> operation where data is sent directly from the
filesystem buffer cache.  This _should_ result in lower CPU
utilization and possibly higher throughput.  If it does not, then you
may want to contact your vendor(s) because they have a problem on
their hands.

   <p>Zero-copy mechanisms may also alter the characteristics (size and
number of buffers per) of packets passed to the NIC.  In many stacks,
when a copy is performed, the stack can &ldquo;reserve&rdquo; space at the
beginning of the destination buffer for things like TCP, IP and Link
headers.  This then has the packet contained in a single buffer which
can be easier to DMA to the NIC.  When no copy is performed, there is
no opportunity to reserve space for headers and so a packet will be
contained in two or more buffers.

   <p>The <a href="#Global-Options">global <span class="option">-F</span> option</a> is required for this test and it must
specify a file of at least the size of the send ring (See <a href="#Global-Options">the global <span class="option">-W</span> option</a>.) multiplied by the send size
(See <a href="#Options-common-to-TCP-UDP-and-SCTP-tests">the test-specific <span class="option">-m</span> option</a>.).  All other TCP-specific options are available
and optional.

   <p>In this first example:
<pre class="example">     $ netperf -H lag -F ../src/netperf -t TCP_SENDFILE -- -s 128K -S 128K
     TCP SENDFILE TEST from 0.0.0.0 (0.0.0.0) port 0 AF_INET to lag.hpl.hp.com (15.4.89.214) port 0 AF_INET
     alloc_sendfile_buf_ring: specified file too small.
     file must be larger than send_width * send_size
</pre>
   <p>we see what happens when the file is too small.  Here:

<pre class="example">     $ ../src/netperf -H lag -F /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.8-1-686 -t TCP_SENDFILE -- -s 128K -S 128K

<h4 class="subsection">5.2.4 UDP_STREAM</h4>

<p>A UDP_STREAM test is similar to a <a href="#TCP_005fSTREAM">TCP_STREAM</a> test except UDP is
used as the transport rather than TCP.

   <p>A UDP_STREAM test has no end-to-end flow control - UDP provides none
and neither does netperf.  However, if you wish, you can configure
netperf with <code>--enable-intervals=yes</code> to enable the global
command-line <span class="option">-b</span> and <span class="option">-w</span> options to pace bursts of
traffic onto the network.

   <p>This has a number of implications.

   <p>The biggest of these implications is the data which is sent might not
be received by the remote.  For this reason, the output of a
UDP_STREAM test shows both the sending and receiving throughput.  On
some platforms, it may be possible for the sending throughput to be
reported as a value greater than the maximum rate of the link.  This
is common when the CPU(s) are faster than the network and there is no
<dfn>intra-stack</dfn> flow-control.

   <p>Here is an example of a UDP_STREAM test between two systems connected
by a 10 Gigabit Ethernet link:
<pre class="example">     $ netperf -t UDP_STREAM -H 192.168.2.125 -- -m 32768
     UDP UNIDIRECTIONAL SEND TEST from 0.0.0.0 (0.0.0.0) port 0 AF_INET to 192.168.2.125 (192.168.2.125) port 0 AF_INET
     Socket  Message  Elapsed      Messages
     Size    Size     Time         Okay Errors   Throughput
     bytes   bytes    secs            #      #   10^6bits/sec
     
     124928   32768   10.00      105672      0    2770.20
     135168           10.00      104844           2748.50
     
</pre>
   <p>The first line of numbers are statistics from the sending (netperf)
side. The second line of numbers are from the receiving (netserver)
side.  In this case, 105672 - 104844 or 828 messages did not make it
all the way to the remote netserver process.

   <p>If the value of the <span class="option">-m</span> option is larger than the local send
socket buffer size (<span class="option">-s</span> option) netperf will likely abort with
an error message about how the send call failed:

<pre class="example">     netperf -t UDP_STREAM -H 192.168.2.125
     UDP UNIDIRECTIONAL SEND TEST from 0.0.0.0 (0.0.0.0) port 0 AF_INET to 192.168.2.125 (192.168.2.125) port 0 AF_INET
     udp_send: data send error: Message too long
</pre>
   <p>If the value of the <span class="option">-m</span> option is larger than the remote
socket receive buffer, the reported receive throughput will likely be
zero as the remote UDP will discard the messages as being too large to
fit into the socket buffer.

<pre class="example">     $ netperf -t UDP_STREAM -H 192.168.2.125 -- -m 65000 -S 32768

<h4 class="subsection">5.2.8 DLCO_STREAM</h4>

<p>A DLPI Connection Oriented Stream (DLCO_STREAM) test is very similar
in concept to a <a href="#TCP_005fSTREAM">TCP_STREAM</a> test.  Both use reliable,
connection-oriented protocols.  The DLPI test differs from the TCP
test in that its protocol operates only at the link-level and does not
include TCP-style segmentation and reassembly.  This last difference
means that the value  passed-in  with the <span class="option">-m</span> option must be
less than the interface MTU.  Otherwise, the <span class="option">-m</span> and
<span class="option">-M</span> options are just like their TCP/UDP/SCTP counterparts.

   <p>Other DLPI-specific options include:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-D &lt;devspec&gt;</code><dd>This option is used to provide the fully-qualified names for the local
and/or remote DPLI device files.  The syntax is otherwise identical to
that of a <dfn>sizespec</dfn>. 
<br><dt><code>-p &lt;ppaspec&gt;</code><dd>This option is used to specify the local and/or remote DLPI PPA(s). 
The PPA is used to identify the interface over which traffic is to be
sent/received. The syntax of a <dfn>ppaspec</dfn> is otherwise the same as
a <dfn>sizespec</dfn>. 
<br><dt><code>-s sap</code><dd>This option specifies the 802.2 SAP for the test.  A SAP is somewhat
like either the port field of a TCP or UDP header or the protocol
field of an IP header.  The specified SAP should not conflict with any
other active SAPs on the specified PPA's (<span class="option">-p</span> option). 
<br><dt><code>-w &lt;sizespec&gt;</code><dd>This option specifies the local send and receive window sizes in units
of frames on those platforms which support setting such things. 
<br><dt><code>-W &lt;sizespec&gt;</code><dd>This option specifies the remote send and receive window sizes in
units of frames on those platforms which support setting such things.

   <p>The DLCO_STREAM test is only present if netperf was configured with

<p>A DLPI ConnectionLess Stream (DLCL_STREAM) test is analogous to a

connection-less transports.  The DLCL_STREAM test differs from the
<a href="#UDP_005fSTREAM">UDP_STREAM</a> test in that the message size (<span class="option">-m</span> option) must
always be less than the link MTU as there is no IP-like fragmentation
and reassembly available and netperf does not presume to provide one.

   <p>The test-specific command-line options for a DLCL_STREAM test are the
same as those for a <a href="#DLCO_005fSTREAM">DLCO_STREAM</a> test.

<p>A Unix Domain Stream Socket Stream test (STREAM_STREAM) is similar in
concept to a <a href="#TCP_005fSTREAM">TCP_STREAM</a> test, but using Unix Domain sockets.  It is,
naturally, limited to intra-machine traffic.  A STREAM_STREAM test
shares the <span class="option">-m</span>, <span class="option">-M</span>, <span class="option">-s</span> and <span class="option">-S</span>
options of the other _STREAM tests.  In a STREAM_STREAM test the
<span class="option">-p</span> option sets the directory in which the pipes will be
created rather than setting a port number.  The default is to create
the pipes in the system default for the <code>tempnam()</code> call.

<h2 class="chapter">6 Using Netperf to Measure Request/Response</h2>

<p>Request/response performance is often overlooked, yet it is just as
important as bulk-transfer performance.  While things like larger
socket buffers and TCP windows can cover a multitude of latency and
even path-length sins, they cannot easily hide from a request/response
test.  The convention for a request/response test is to have a _RR
suffix.  There are however a few &ldquo;request/response&rdquo; tests that have
other suffixes.

   <p>A request/response test, particularly synchronous, one transaction at
at time test such as those found in netperf, is particularly sensitive
to the path-length of the networking stack.  An _RR test can also
uncover those platforms where the NIC's are strapped by default with
overbearing interrupt avoidance settings in an attempt to increase the
bulk-transfer performance (or rather, decrease the CPU utilization of
a bulk-transfer test).  This sensitivity is most acute for small
request and response sizes, such as the single-byte default for a
netperf _RR test.

   <p>While a bulk-transfer test reports its results in units of bits or
bytes transfered per second, a mumble_RR test reports transactions per
second where a transaction is defined as the completed exchange of a
request and a response.  One can invert the transaction rate to arrive
at the average round-trip latency.  If one is confident about the
symmetry of the connection, the average one-way latency can be taken
as one-half the average round-trip latency.  Netperf does not do
either of these on its own but leaves them as exercises to the
benchmarker.

<h3 class="section">6.1 Issues in Reqeust/Response</h3>

<p>Most if not all the <a href="#Issues-in-Bulk-Transfer">Issues in Bulk Transfer</a> apply to
request/response.  The issue of round-trip latency is even more
important as netperf only has one transaction outstanding at a time.

   <p>A single instance of an _RR test should _never_ completely saturate
the CPU of a system.  If testing between otherwise evenly matched
systems, the symmetric nature of a _RR test with equal request and
response sizes should result in equal CPU loading on both systems.

   <p>For smaller request and response sizes packet loss is a bigger issue
as there is no opportunity for a <dfn>fast retransmit</dfn> or
retransmission prior to a retrnamission timer expiring.

   <p>Certain NICs have ways to minimize the number of interrupts sent to
the host.  If these are strapped badly they can significantly reduce
the performance of something like a single-byte request/response test. 
Such setups are distinguised by seriously low reported CPU utilization
and what seems like a low (even if in the thousands) transaction per
second rate.  Also, if you run such an OS/driver combination on faster
or slower hardware and do not see a corresponding change in the
transaction rate, chances are good that the drvier is strapping the
NIC with aggressive interrupt avoidance settings.  Good for bulk
throughput, but bad for latency.

   <p>Some drivers may try to automagically adjust the interrupt avoidance
settings.  If they are not terribly good at it, you will see
considerable run-to-run variation in reported transaction rates. 
Particularly if you &ldquo;mix-up&rdquo; _STREAM and _RR tests.

<h3 class="section">6.2 Options Common to TCP UDP and SCTP _RR tests</h3>

<p>Many &ldquo;test-specific&rdquo; options are actually common across the
different tests.  For those tests involving TCP, UDP and SCTP, whether
using the BSD Sockets or the XTI interface those common options
include:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-h</code><dd>Display the test-suite-specific usage string and exit.  For a TCP_ or
UDP_ test this will be the usage string from the source file
<span class="file">nettest_bsd.c</span>.  For an XTI_ test, this will be the usage string
from the source file <span class="file">src/nettest_xti.c</span>.  For an SCTP test, this
will be the usage string from the source file
<span class="file">src/nettest_sctp.c</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-H &lt;optionspec&gt;</code><dd>Normally, the remote hostname|IP and address family information is
inherited from the settings for the control connection (eg global
command-line <span class="option">-H</span>, <span class="option">-4</span> and/or <span class="option">-6</span> options. 
The test-specific <span class="option">-H</span> will override those settings for the
data (aka test) connection only.  Settings for the control connection
are left unchanged.  This might be used to cause the control and data
connections to take different paths through the network.

     <br><dt><code>-L &lt;optionspec&gt;</code><dd>The test-specific <span class="option">-L</span> option is identical to the test-specific
<span class="option">-H</span> option except it affects the local hostname|IP and address
family information.  As with its global command-line counterpart, this
is generally only useful when measuring though those evil, end-to-end
breaking things called firewalls.

     <br><dt><code>-P &lt;optionspec&gt;</code><dd>Set the local and/or remote port numbers for the data connection.

     <br><dt><code>-r &lt;sizespec&gt;</code><dd>This option sets the request (first value) and/or response (second
value) sizes for an _RR test. By default the units are bytes, but a
suffix of &ldquo;G,&rdquo; &ldquo;M,&rdquo; or &ldquo;K&rdquo; will specify the units to be 2^30
(GB), 2^20 (MB) or 2^10 (KB) respectively.  A suffix of &ldquo;g,&rdquo; &ldquo;m&rdquo;

<h4 class="subsection">6.2.1 TCP_RR</h4>

<p>A TCP_RR (TCP Request/Response) test is requested by passing a value
of &ldquo;TCP_RR&rdquo; to the global <span class="option">-t</span> command-line option.  A TCP_RR
test can be though-of as a user-space to user-space <code>ping</code> with
no think time - it is a synchronous, one transaction at a time,
request/response test.

   <p>The transaction rate is the number of complete transactions exchanged
divided by the length of time it took to perform those transactions.

   <p>If the two Systems Under Test are otherwise identical, a TCP_RR test
with the same request and response size should be symmetric - it
should not matter which way the test is run, and the CPU utilization
measured should be virtually the same on each system.  If not, it
suggests that the CPU utilization mechanism being used may have some,
well, issues measuring CPU utilization completely and accurately.

   <p>Time to establish the TCP connection is not counted in the result.  If
you want connection setup overheads included, you should consider the
TCP_CC or TCP_CRR tests.

   <p>If specifying the <span class="option">-D</span> option to set TCP_NODELAY and disable
the Nagle Algorithm increases the transaction rate reported by a
TCP_RR test, it implies the stack(s) over which the TCP_RR test is
running have a broken implementation of the Nagle Algorithm.  Likely
as not they are interpreting Nagle on a segment by segment basis
rather than a user send by user send basis.  You should contact your
stack vendor(s) to report the problem to them.

   <p>Here is an example of two systems running a basic TCP_RR test over a
10 Gigabit Ethernet link:

<pre class="example">     netperf -t TCP_RR -H 192.168.2.125
     TCP REQUEST/RESPONSE TEST from 0.0.0.0 (0.0.0.0) port 0 AF_INET to 192.168.2.125 (192.168.2.125) port 0 AF_INET
     Local /Remote
     Socket Size   Request  Resp.   Elapsed  Trans.
     Send   Recv   Size     Size    Time     Rate
     bytes  Bytes  bytes    bytes   secs.    per sec
     
     16384  87380  1        1       10.00    29150.15
     16384  87380
</pre>
   <p>In this example the request and response sizes were one byte, the
socket buffers were left at their defaults, and the test ran for all
of 10 seconds.  The transaction per second rate was rather good :)

<h4 class="subsection">6.2.2 TCP_CC</h4>

<p>A TCP_CC (TCP Connect/Close) test is requested by passing a value of
&ldquo;TCP_CC&rdquo; to the global <span class="option">-t</span> option.  A TCP_CC test simply
measures how fast the pair of systems can open and close connections
between one another in a synchronous (one at a time) manner.  While
this is considered an _RR test, no request or response is exchanged
over the connection.

   <p>The issue of TIME_WAIT reuse is an important one for a TCP_CC test. 
Basically, TIME_WAIT reuse is when a pair of systems churn through
connections fast enough that they wrap the 16-bit port number space in
less time than the length of the TIME_WAIT state.  While it is indeed
theoretically possible to &ldquo;reuse&rdquo; a connection in TIME_WAIT, the
conditions under which such reuse is possible is rather rare.  An
attempt to reuse a connection in TIME_WAIT can result in a non-trivial
delay in connection establishment.

   <p>Basically, any time the connection churn rate approaches:

   <p>Sizeof(clientportspace) / Lengthof(TIME_WAIT)

   <p>there is the risk of TIME_WAIT reuse.  To minimize the chances of this
happening, netperf will by default select its own client port numbers
from the range of 5000 to 65535.  On systems with a 60 second
TIME_WAIT state, this should allow roughly 1000 transactions per
second.  The size of the client port space used by netperf can be
controlled via the test-specific <span class="option">-p</span> option, which takes a
<dfn>sizespec</dfn> as a value setting the minimum (first value) and
maximum (second value) port numbers used by netperf at the client end.

   <p>Since no requests or responses are exchanged during a TCP_CC test,
only the <span class="option">-H</span>, <span class="option">-L</span>, <span class="option">-4</span> and <span class="option">-6</span> of the
&ldquo;common&rdquo; test-specific options are likely to have an effect, if any,
on the results.  The <span class="option">-s</span> and <span class="option">-S</span> options _may_ have
some effect if they alter the number and/or type of options carried in
the TCP SYNchronize segments.  The <span class="option">-P</span>  and <span class="option">-r</span>
options are utterly ignored.

   <p>Since connection establishment and tear-down for TCP is not symmetric,
a TCP_CC test is not symmetric in its loading of the two systems under
test.

<h4 class="subsection">6.2.3 TCP_CRR</h4>

<p>The TCP Connect/Request/Response (TCP_CRR) test is requested by
passing a value of &ldquo;TCP_CRR&rdquo; to the global <span class="option">-t</span> command-line
option.  A TCP_RR test is like a merger of a TCP_RR and TCP_CC test
which measures the performance of establishing a connection, exchanging
a single request/response transaction, and tearing-down that
connection.  This is very much like what happens in an HTTP 1.0 or
HTTP 1.1 connection when HTTP Keepalives are not used.  In fact, the
TCP_CRR test was added to netperf to simulate just that.

   <p>Since a request and response are exchanged the <span class="option">-r</span>,
<span class="option">-s</span> and <span class="option">-S</span> options can have an effect on the
performance.

   <p>The issue of TIME_WAIT reuse exists for the TCP_CRR test just as it
does for the TCP_CC test.  Similarly, since connection establishment
and tear-down is not symmetric, a TCP_CRR test is not symmetric even
when the request and response sizes are the same.

<h4 class="subsection">6.2.4 UDP_RR</h4>

<p>A UDP Request/Response (UDP_RR) test is requested by passing a value
of &ldquo;UDP_RR&rdquo; to a global <span class="option">-t</span> option.  It is very much the
same as a TCP_RR test except UDP is used rather than TCP.

   <p>UDP does not provide for retransmission of lost UDP datagrams, and
netperf does not add anything for that either.  This means that if
_any_ request or response is lost, the exchange of requests and
responses will stop from that point until the test timer expires. 
Netperf will not really &ldquo;know&rdquo; this has happened - the only symptom
will be a low transaction per second rate.

   <p>The netperf side of a UDP_RR test will call <code>connect()</code> on its
data socket and thenceforth use the <code>send()</code> and <code>recv()</code>
socket calls.  The netserver side of a UDP_RR test will not call
<code>connect()</code> and will use <code>recvfrom()</code> and <code>sendto()</code>
calls.  This means that even if the request and response sizes are the
same, a UDP_RR test is _not_ symmetric in its loading of the two
systems under test.

   <p>Here is an example of a UDP_RR test between two otherwise
identical two-CPU systems joined via a 1 Gigabit Ethernet network:

<pre class="example">     $ netperf -T 1 -H 192.168.1.213 -t UDP_RR -c -C
     UDP REQUEST/RESPONSE TEST from 0.0.0.0 (0.0.0.0) port 0 AF_INET to 192.168.1.213 (192.168.1.213) port 0 AF_INET
     Local /Remote
     Socket Size   Request Resp.  Elapsed Trans.   CPU    CPU    S.dem   S.dem
     Send   Recv   Size    Size   Time    Rate     local  remote local   remote
     bytes  bytes  bytes   bytes  secs.   per sec  % I    % I    us/Tr   us/Tr
     
     65535  65535  1       1      10.01   15262.48   13.90  16.11  18.221  21.116
     65535  65535
</pre>
   <p>This example includes the <span class="option">-c</span> and <span class="option">-C</span> options to
enable CPU utilization reporting and shows the asymmetry in CPU
loading.  The <span class="option">-T</span> option was used to make sure netperf and
netserver ran on a given CPU and did not move around during the test.

<h2 class="chapter">7 Other Netperf Tests</h2>

<p>Apart from the typical performance tests, netperf contains some tests
which can be used to streamline measurements and reporting.  These
include CPU rate calibration (present) and host identification (future
enhancement).

<ul class="menu">
<li><a accesskey="1" href="#CPU-rate-calibration">CPU rate calibration</a>

</div>

<h3 class="section">7.1 CPU rate calibration</h3>

<p>Some of the CPU utilization measurement mechanisms of netperf work by
comparing the rate at which some counter increments when the system is
idle with the rate at which that same counter increments when the
system is running a netperf test.  The ratio of those rates is used to
arrive at a CPU utilization percentage.

   <p>This means that netperf must know the rate at which the counter
increments when the system is presumed to be &ldquo;idle.&rdquo;  If it does not
know the rate, netperf will measure it before starting a data transfer
test.  This calibration step takes 40 seconds for each of the local or
remote ystems, and if repeated for each netperf test would make taking
repeated measurements rather slow.

   <p>Thus, the netperf CPU utilization options <span class="option">-c</span> and and
<span class="option">-C</span> can take an optional calibration value.  This value is
used as the &ldquo;idle rate&rdquo; and the calibration step is not
performed. To determine the idle rate, netperf can be used to run
special tests which only report the value of the calibration - they
are the LOC_CPU and REM_CPU tests.  These return the calibration value
for the local and remote system respectively.  A common way to use
these tests is to store their results into an environment variable and
use that in subsequent netperf commands:

<pre class="example">     LOC_RATE=`netperf -t LOC_CPU`
     REM_RATE=`netperf -H &lt;remote&gt; -t REM_CPU`
     netperf -H &lt;remote&gt; -c $LOC_RATE -C $REM_RATE ... -- ...
     ...
     netperf -H &lt;remote&gt; -c $LOC_RATE -C $REM_RATE ... -- ...
</pre>
   <p>If you are going to use netperf to measure aggregate results, it is
important to use the LOC_CPU and REM_CPU tests to get the calibration
values first to avoid issues with some of the aggregate netperf tests
transferring data while others are &ldquo;idle&rdquo; and getting bogus
calibration values.  When running aggregate tests, it is very
important to remember that any one instance of netperf does not know
about the other instances of netperf.  It will report global CPU
utilization and will calculate service demand believing it was the
only thing causing that CPU utilization.  So, you can use the CPU
utilization reported by netperf in an aggregate test, but you have to
calculate service demands by hand.

<h2 class="chapter">8 Address Resolution</h2>

<p>Netperf versions 2.4.0 and later have merged IPv4 and IPv6 tests so
the functionality of the tests in <span class="file">src/nettest_ipv6.c</span> has been
subsumed into the tests in <span class="file">src/nettest_bsd.c</span>  This has been
accomplished in part by switching from <code>gethostbyname()</code>to
<code>getaddrinfo()</code> exclusively.  While it was theoretically possible
to get multiple results for a hostname from <code>gethostbyname()</code> it
was generally unlikely and netperf's ignoring of the second and later
results was not much of an issue.

   <p>Now with <code>getaddrinfo</code> and particularly with AF_UNSPEC it is
increasingly likely that a given hostname will have multiple
associated addresses.  The <code>establish_control()</code> routine of
<span class="file">src/netlib.c</span> will indeed attempt to chose from among all the
matching IP addresses when establishing the control connection. 
Netperf does not _really_ care if the control connection is IPv4 or
IPv6 or even mixed on either end.

   <p>However, the individual tests still ass-u-me that the first result in
the address list is the one to be used.  Whether or not this will
turn-out to be an issue has yet to be determined.

   <p>If you do run into problems with this, the easiest workaround is to
specify IP addresses for the data connection explicitly in the
test-specific <span class="option">-H</span> and <span class="option">-L</span> options.  At some point, the
netperf tests _may_ try to be more sophisticated in their parsing of
returns from <code>getaddrinfo()</code> - straw-man patches to
<a href="mailto:netperf-feedback@netperf.org">netperf-feedback@netperf.org</a> would of course be most welcome
:)

   <p>Netperf has leveraged code from other open-source projects with
amenable licensing to provide a replacement <code>getaddrinfo()</code> call
on those platforms where the <span class="command">configure</span> script believes there
is no native getaddrinfo call.  As of this writing, the replacement
<code>getaddrinfo()</code> as been tested on HP-UX 11.0 and then presumed to
run elsewhere.

<p>Netperf is constantly evolving.  If you find you want to make
enhancements to netperf, by all means do so.  If you wish to add a new
&ldquo;suite&rdquo; of tests to netperf the general idea is to

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Add files <span class="file">src/nettest_mumble.c</span> and <span class="file">src/nettest_mumble.h</span>
where mumble is replaced with something meaningful for the test-suite. 
<li>Add support for an apropriate <span class="option">--enable-mumble</span> option in
<span class="file">configure.ac</span>. 
<li>Edit <span class="file">src/netperf.c</span>, <span class="file">netsh.c</span>, and <span class="file">netserver.c</span> as
required, using #ifdef WANT_MUMBLE. 
<li>Compile and test
        </ol>

   <p>If you wish to submit your changes for possible inclusion into the
mainline sources, please try to base your changes on the latest
available sources. (See <a href="#Getting-Netperf-Bits">Getting Netperf Bits</a>.) and then send email
describing the changes at a high level to
<a href="mailto:netperf-feedback@netperf.org">netperf-feedback@netperf.org</a> or perhaps
<a href="mailto:netperf-talk@netperf.org">netperf-talk@netperf.org</a>.  If the concensus is positive, then
sending context <span class="command">diff</span> results to
<a href="mailto:netperf-feedback@netperf.org">netperf-feedback@netperf.org</a> is the next step.  From that
point, it is a matter of pestering the Netperf Contributing Editor
until he gets the changes incorporated :)

   <p>One of these days, it is hoped that some sort of public version
control system will be setup - perhaps on netperf.org - to make this
whole process easier.
