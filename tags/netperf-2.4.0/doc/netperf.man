.SH NAME

netperf \- a network performance benchmark

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B netperf
[global options] -- [test specific options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Netperf
is a benchmark that can be used to measure various aspects of
networking performance.
Currently, its focus is on bulk data transfer and request/response
performance using either TCP or UDP, and the Berkeley Sockets
interface. In addition, tests for DLPI, and Unix Domain
Sockets, tests for IPv6 may be conditionally compiled-in.

.SS GLOBAL OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-a sizespec
Alter the send and receive buffer alignments on the local system.
This defaults to 8 bytes.
.TP
.B \-A sizespec
As -a, but for the remote system.
.TP
.B \-c [rate]
Request CPU utilization and service demand calculations for the
local system. If the optional rate parameter is specified,
.B netperf
will use that instead of calculating the rate itself.
.TP
.B \-C [rate]
As -c, but for the remote system.
.TP
.B \-d
Increase the quantity of debugging output displayed during
a test (possibly at the expense of performance).
.TP
.B \-f GMKgmk
Change the units of measure for *_STREAM tests. Capital letters are
powers of two, lowercase are powers of ten.
.TP
.B \-F fill_file
Pre-fill the send buffers with data from the named file. This is
intended to provide a means for avoiding buffers that are filled with
data which is trivially easy to compress. A good choice for a file
that should be present on any system is this manpage - netperf.man.
Other files may be provided as part of the distribution.
.TP
.B \-h
Display a usage string, and exit.
.TP
.B \-H remote_host,local_host
Set the hostname (or IP address) of the remote system. Passing a
single name with no comma will only set remote_host and will leave
selection of local IP address for the control connection to the stack.
Specifying ",local_host" will only set local_host and will leave
remote_host at the default. 
.TP
.B \-i max,min
Set the maximum and minimum number of iterations when trying to reach
certain confidence levels.
.TP
.B \-I lvl,[,intvl]
Specify the confidence level (either 95 or 99 - 99 is the default) and
the width of the confidence interval as a percentage (default 10)
.TP
.B \-l testlen
Specify the length of the test (default 10 seconds).
A negative value sets the number of request/response transactions,
or the number of bytes for a stream test.
.TP
.B \-n numcpus
Specify the number of CPU's in the system on those systems for which
netperf has no way to find the number of CPU's programatically. 
.TP
.B \-o sizespec
Set an offset from the alignment specified with -a.
.TP
.B \-O sizespec
As -o, but for the remote system.
.TP
.B \-p portnum,locport
Connect to a
.C netserver
listening on the specified port, rather than using /etc/services. If
",locport" is specified the control connection will be established
from that local port number.  Specifying a single port number with no
comma will specify only the remote
.C netserver
port number and will leave local port number selection to the stack.
.TP
.B \-P 0|1
Show (1) or suppress (0) the test banner.
.TP
.B \-t testname
Specify the test to perform.
Valid testnames are (but not always compiled-in):
.RS
.RS
.nf
.I TCP_STREAM
.I TCP_MAERTS
.I TCP_RR
.I TCP_CRR
.I UDP_STREAM
.I UDP_RR
.I TCPIPV6_STREAM
.I TCPIPV6_RR
.I TCPIPV6_CRR
.I UDPIPV6_STREAM
.I UDPIPV6_RR
.I DLCO_STREAM
.I DLCO_RR
.I DLCL_STREAM
.I DLCL_RR
.I STREAM_STREAM
.I STREAM_RR
.I DG_STREAM
.I DG_RR
.I LOC_CPU
.I REM_CPU
.fi
.RE
.RE
.TP
.B \-v verbosity
Set the verbosity level for the test (only with -P).
.TP
.B \-V
Enable the copy-avoidance features (HP-UX 9.0 and later only).

.SS TEST SPECIFIC OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-h
Display a usage string based on the test name set with -t, and exit.
