Pseudo-random things about netperf on AIX:

While it _should_ not be necessary in the release bits, the rc bits
for netperf 2.4.0 required:

    configure may need:

    CFLAGS="-qcpluscmt -lperfstat"

    until such time as Rick Jones can figure-out or be told how to
    automagically add those using the configure script (hint hint :)

The release bits should be OK without the above.
