These are the Release Notes for the 2.1 revision of netperf:

Things Changed in this release:

*) The XTI (Version 2 of the spec) tests are now documented in the
   manual. 

*) The TCP_CRR (Connect Request/Response) test is now documented in
   the manual, including a description of how it mimics the behaviour
   of http (the protocol underlying the WWW).

*) Support for for Windows NT 3.51 OS in the BSD Sockets tests (ok, so
   they are really Winsock in that case :). Other test suites may be
   ported as required/desired/appropriate. 

*) Tests for TCP and UDP, using the IPv6 extensions to BSD sockets are
   included in this release. They are included by adding -DUSE_IPv6 to
   the makefile and recompiling.

*) Support for a "long long" datatype should only be required for
   -DUSE_PSTAT compilation which is an HP-UX only thing. The
   *unbundled* HP compilers from at least "HP92453-01 A.09.61 HP C
   Compiler" and later should have the required support. The bundled
   compiler may not. GCC should work - check the archives listed in
   the comp.sys.hp.hpux FAQ for copies. The FAQ is archived on
   rtfm.mit.edu under the path pub/usenet/comp.sys.hp.hpux.

*) A "proper" fix for double data type alignment has been included.

*) A new script is included with this release which can be used to
   measure aggregate TCP_RR performance (multiple, concurrent
   instances of the TCP_RR test). A related use of this script would
   be measuring MP scaling. A single-byte TCP_RR test is good for this
   purpose for two reasons:

      1) it excercises the control/protocol paths heavily without
         using much in the way of data copies which may be easier to
         scale.
      2) most systems can easily saturate cards with bandwidth, but
         not so easily with request/response

   Of course, feedback on this is most welcome.

*) When measuring CPU utilization, the units for service demand have
   been changed from milliseconds (designated ms) of CPU per unit (KB
   or Transaction) to microseconds (desginated us).

*) For accurate reporting of service demand, netperf needs to know the
   number of CPU's present on a system. On some systems (HP-UX), this
   is automatic. For others (All), it is necessary to add a global "-n
   <numcpu>" option to both netperf and netserver.

   !! IF THIS IS LEFT-OUT CPU UTILIZATION AND SERVICE DEMAND FOR !!
	     !! MULTI-PROCESSOR SYSTEMS WILL BE WRONG. !!

   If you know of ways to programatically determine the number of
   active CPUs on a system, please let the author Rick Jones
   <raj@cup.hp.com> know.

*) other things I've probably forgotten :)

Things Not Changed in this release:

*) The ancillary test suites are essentially unchanged - DLPI,
   HiPPI/LLA, Unix Domain, and Fore ATM API. Unless there is much
   interest expressed in these tests, 2.1 may be the last release in
   which they are included. The order of retirement would likely be
   Unix Domain, HiPPI/LLA, Fore ATM API, and then DLPI.

Miscelaneous Comments:

*) The -DUSE_LOOPER CPU utilization _seems_ to be nice and low-impact
   on HP-UX, Digital Unix, and IRIX. It does not yet seem to be
   low-impact on Solaris (I need an example of priocntl usage), AIX
   (setpri only works if you are root), and NT (not sure of the
   reason). Help with those problems would be most appreciated.
